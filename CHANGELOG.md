### link

* Fixed linking when custom NPM prefixes are used via `.npmrc` files.

### eject

Updated all dependencies to latest releases and added support for TypeScript. In keeping with community standards, CSS/LESS is now processed in the global scope, while modular CSS can be retained by using the `.module.css`/`.module.less` extension or setting the `forceCSSModules` Enact project setting in `package.json`.

### create

* Updated default included moonstone template for latest Enact with `.module.less` modular LESS naming format.

### link

* Improved handling and errors when linking into a non-Enact project.

### transpile

* Added `--commonjs` option, enabled by default, which will convert all ES6 import/export statements into CommonJS.
* LESS files will now be transpiled into CSS. Directories named `style` will not transpile LESS and will just copy the files (useful for sharing LESS variables/mixins). Directories named `internal`  within `styles` will be ignored.

## 1.2.1 (December 7, 2018)

* Fixed test execution failures where an old copy of Enzyme was erroring out on the latest React 1.6 releases.

* Added support for `@global-import "<file>";` syntax to import CSS files in a global context.
* Added support for boolean flag option `externalStartup` in the enact options in a project's `package.json`. When true, any prerender startup scripts will be external file assets, rather than embedded inline javascript.
* Fixed `@babel/polyfill` failing to be transpiled into targeted `core-js` components. Additionally now ensures polyfills aren't loaded more than once.
* Fixed v8 snapshot support for React 16.4.1.
* Relocated the old `./config/proptype-checker.js` into its own standalone [`mocha-react-proptype-checker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-react-proptype-checker) package.
* Production mode limits the UglifyJS options to ECMA 5 optimizations only.

* Depreciated isomorphic HTML-side rendering. Isomorphic entrypoints should render to the DOM when in a browser environment.

### clean

* Fixed clean command failing due to missing internal parameters.


## 0.4.0 (December 5, 2016)

### create

* Renamed `init` command to `create` for clarity of purpose.
* Template updated for Enact 1.0.0-alpha.4

### transpile

* Fixed fs-extra depreciation warning about using a RegExp in copying.

### pack

* Added support for overriding with a custom HTML template.
* Viewport meta tags added to restrict user-scale to 1.
* Documented `package.json` Enact build options in README.md.
* Fixed app rendering in isomorphic code layout, where apps exported as ES6 default would fail to render.
* Fixed ReactPerf bundling with React 15.4.x, with backwards support for earlier versions.
* Fixed `--watch` support.

### test

* Properly ignore ./dist and ./build directories when searching for tests.
* Removed unneeded sourcemap support to greatly improved memory management and avoid js heap crashes in PhantomJS.


## 0.3.0 (November 7, 2016)

### init

* Sanitizes directory name so only valid characters are included as the package name.
* Template updated for Enact 1.0.0-alpha.3

### pack

* Added `-s`/`--stats` flag to generate a stats.html bundle analysis report.
* Fixed development build failure when generating sourcemaps.
* Refactored ESLint configuration with an optional strict mode.
* Updated `eslint` to use 3.9.1 for new rule support.
* Updated `eslint-plugin-enact` to 6.5.0 for new rule support.

### serve

* Browser no longer automatically opens. Use `-b`/`--browser` flag to re-enable the feature.
* Fixed serve failure when generating sourcemaps.


## 0.2.0 (October 21, 2016)

* Refactored entire project into a dedicated standalone global CLI with features/functionality integrated from
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

### init

* Added `-h`/`--help` information.
* Verifies the user has a compatible Node version.
* Verifies the destination directory is safe to create a project in.
* Template now include webOS meta files (appinfo.json, icons.png, etc.).
* Template updated for Enact 1.0.0-alpha.2
* The package.json and appinfo.json will update their respective `name`/`id` to the project directory's name.
* Added `--verbose` flag option to provide detailed logging.
* Added `--link` flag option to link any dependencies that have been `npm link` rather than install.
* Added `--local` flag option to include enact-dev as a local devDependency (not recommended for general usage).
* Renovated user interface with basic NPM script usage information included.

### pack

* Switched from using `babel-polyfill` to a more simplified set of polyfills covering Promise, Object.assign,
  String.prototype.codePointAt, String.fromCodePoint, Math.sign, and Fetch APIs
* Scans files with ESLint as part of the build process, failing on errors.
* Switched from OS-level to a local ./node_modules/.cache/ location for babel caching in development mode.
* Support auto-prefixing of CSS.
* Supports development-only CSS class `.__DEV__` which will exist withing development builds but be removed in production
  builds.
* Includes CaseSensitivePathsPlugin to ensure paths meet case-sensitive requirements regardless of system.
* Converted webos-meta-loader into a standalone plugin that will auto-detect the appinfo.json and ensure its webOS meta assets get
  copied over during build time. Additionally, if an appinfo.json is found, the `title` value will be inserted into the output
  HTML `<title></title>`.
* PrerenderPlugin now handles Node-based Fetch API to allow isomorphic fetch operations (via @enact/fetch).
* PrerenderPlugin will output a stack trace on failure and allow continue the build without prerendering.
* Isomorphic build format is no longer its own mode, but is now a `-i`/`--isomorphic` flag option, which will apply isomorphic layout
  to whatever the active build mode is (development or production). When the flag is present, the `isomorphic` package.json enact property
  will be used as the entrypoint.
* The `prerender` enact property within package.json has been renamed `isomorphic` for clarity (backward compatible)
* Simplified console output, detailing output files, file sizes, and changes in size from previous build.

### serve

* Verifies the desired port (8080) is open and allows selecting of an alternate if occupied.
* Simplified output with understandable messages.
* Optional proxy server support.
* Webpage will automatically open when a dev-server session begins.
* The dev-server client in `react-dev-utils` allows build error details to render into the browser window.

## 0.1.0 (September 29, 2016)

* Initial internal release
