## Unreleased

### lint

* Updated dependencies for eslint. If you are using editor-based linting, please update your global dependencies to match.
* Additional options may be passed to the lint command.  Use the following format:  `npm run lint -- --my-option .`.  When passing additional options you must specify the file or directory to lint.

## 0.5.1 (January 27, 2017)

### create

* Template updated for Enact 1.0.0-beta.2 and React 15.4.2.
* Template's .gitignore file now correctly includes `dist`.

### pack

* Added a `node` Enact build option to support polyfilling NodeJS components. See [here](https://github.com/enyojs/enact-dev/blob/master/README.md#enact-build-options) for more info.
* All localized appinfo.json resources and assets will now be correctly copied to the output directory.

### test

* Added a polyfill for String.prototype.repeat, as phantomjs lacks the API.
* Webpack build warnings will no longer spam the console in certain scenarios.
* Test action will now automatically fail when no test suite is found. This was done to allows tests which build incorrect or have missing modules to correctly fail. See [#38](https://github.com/enyojs/enact-dev/pull/38) for more background information.


## 0.5.0 (December 20, 2016)

Several additional documentation files have been added to the `docs` directory, to cover common topics.

### create

* Template updated for Enact 1.0.0-beta.1
* Template has been updated to use a single isomorphic-compatible entrypoint [index.js](https://github.com/enyojs/enact-dev/blob/master/template/src/index.js).

## serve

* Added support for `--host` option to specify a server host IP address to use.
* Added support for `--port` option to specify a server port humber to use.
* The host/port details will now correctly output when linter warnings occur.

### pack

* Added primary support for singluar entrypoints for both regular and isomorphic code layouts.
* Refactored build customization features (like `--isomorphic` and `--stats`) into separate files and cleaned up the implementations.
* Depreciated isomorphic HTML-side rendering. Isomorphic entrypoints should render to the DOM when in a browser environment.

### clean

* Fixed clean command failing due to missing internal parameters.


## 0.4.0 (December 5, 2016)

### create

* Renamed `init` command to `create` for clarity of purpose.

### pack

* Added support for overriding with a custom HTML template.
* Viewport meta tags added to restrict user-scale to 1.
* Documented `package.json` Enact build options in README.md.
* Fixed app rendering in isomorphic code layout, where apps exported as ES6 default would fail to render.
* Fixed ReactPerf bundling with React 15.4.x, with backwards support for earlier versions.
* Fixed `--watch` support.

### test

* Properly ignore ./dist and ./build directories when searching for tests.
* Removed unneeded sourcemap support to greatly improved memory management and avoid js heap crashes in PhantomJS.


## 0.3.0 (November 7, 2016)

### init

* Sanitizes directory name so only valid characters are included as the package name.
* Template updated for Enact 1.0.0-alpha.3

### pack

* Added `-s`/`--stats` flag to generate a stats.html bundle analysis report.
* Fixed development build failure when generating sourcemaps.
* Refactored ESLint configuration with an optional strict mode.
* Updated `eslint` to use 3.9.1 for new rule support.
* Updated `eslint-plugin-enact` to 6.5.0 for new rule support.

### serve

* Fixed serve failure when generating sourcemaps.


## 0.2.0 (October 21, 2016)

* Refactored entire project into a dedicated standalone global CLI with features/functionality integrated from 
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

### init

* Added `-h`/`--help` information.
* Verifies the user has a compatible Node version.
* Verifies the destination directory is safe to create a project in.
* Template now include webOS meta files (appinfo.json, icons.png, etc.).
* Template updated for Enact 1.0.0-alpha.2
* The package.json and appinfo.json will update their respective `name`/`id` to the project directory's name.
* Added `--verbose` flag option to provide detailed logging.
* Added `--link` flag option to link any dependencies that have been `npm link` rathen than install.
* Added `--local` flag option to include enact-dev as a local devDependency (not recommended for general usage).
* Rennovated user interface with basic NPM script usage information included.

### pack

* Switched from using `babel-polyfill` to a more simplified set of polyfills covering Promise, Object.assign, 
  String.prototype.codePointAt, String.fromCodePoint, Math.sign, and Fetch APIs
* Scans files with ESLint as part of the build process, failing on errors.
* Switched from OS-level to a local ./node_modules/.cache/ location for babel caching in development mode.
* Support auto-prefixing of CSS.
* Supports development-only CSS class `.__DEV__` which will exist withing development builds but be removed in production
  builds.
* Includes CaseSensitivePathsPlugin to ensure paths meet case-sensitive requirements regardless of system.
* Converted webos-meta-loader into a standalone plugin that will autodetect the appinfo.json and ensure its webOS meta assets get
  copied over during buildtime. Additionally, if an appinfo.json is found, the `title` value will be inserted into the output
  HTML `<title></title>`.
* PrerenderPlugin now handles Node-based Fetch API to allow isomorphic fetch operations (via @enact/fetch).
* PrerenderPlugin will output a stack strace on failure and allow continue the build without prerendering.
* Isomorphic build format is no longer its own mode, but is now a `-i`/`--isomorphic` flag option, which will apply isomorphic layout
  to whatever the active build mode is (development or production). When the flag is present, the `isomorphic` package.json enact property
  will be used as the entrypoint.
* The `prerender` enact property within package.json has been renamed `isomorphic` for clarity (backward compatible)
* Simplified console output, detailing output files, filesizes, and changes in size from previous build.

### serve

* Verifies the desired port (8080) is open and allows selecting of an alternate if occupied.
* Simplified output with understandable messages.
* Optional proxy server support.
* Webpage will automatically open when a dev-server session begins.
