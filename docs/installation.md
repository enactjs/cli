## Requirements

Node 6.4 or later.

## Installation via npm

Standard global installation of `@enact/cli` via npm. For Linux `sudo` may be required.

```sh
npm install -g @enact/cli
```

All releases are published, with the default (and `latest` tag) being the current stable release. Unreleased and development builds can be installed by installing from the git repository directly (for example, `enactjs/cli#develop`).
