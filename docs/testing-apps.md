## Running Test Specs
```
  Usage
    enact test [options]

  Options:
    --watch           Watch for file changes after initoial test run and re-execute as needed.
    --no-cache        Ignore cached test result data
    ... (all other options supportd by Jest are allowed)
```
The `enact test` command (aliased as `npm run test`) will activate a [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test runner on all discovered *-specs.js files. All the complicated configuration is hidden away within Enact CLI to avoid any confusion or additional difficulty in testing source code.

Internally Enact CLI supports [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) out of the box, so there's no need to install them locally on your project. Simply import/require it within specs files and it'll be there. You will want to familiarize your self with Enzyme's utilities in order to write more complex tests.

To create a test please create a ***-specs.js** file in the folder of the component you wish to test.

Run --help for more information on available options.
